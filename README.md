# Surfs_up
### Overview
The purpose of this Analysis is to get a Surf and Shake shop up and running. In order to pull this off he will need some financial assistance from
investors. Investors want to know their investment will have an ROI so they are requesting analysis om the weather to make sure its a good fit. This
is where the analysis comes into play. For the challenge we have been asked to ana;yze temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine business sustainability year around.

### Analysis
When comparing weather from June and December I think it's vital to look for Key differences in the descriptive statistics. I will start
off by providing images of both charts.
- I used the .describe() function to display descriptive statistics for both June and December.

When it comes to the averages they are around 4 degrees apart with December having a comfortable temperature of 71.041529 and June having a slightly warmer 
temperature of 74.944118. The minimum temperature is an 8 degree difference making it little more noticeable. December has a minimum temperature of 56 and June has a minimum temperature of 64. The maxes for both months is only a 2 degree difference with December maxing out at 83 and June maxing out at 85. All 
in all there is not a drastic change in the temperature from June to December

### Summary
When looking at the business overall I think it would stay relatibely consistent throughtout the year. Of course it may decrease some in December but only on days when its abnormally cool. Usually the temperature is right at 70 which is comfortable weather for Surf and ice cream. I do think the company should account for a slight decrease in business throughtout December as the minimum temperature is 8 degrees colder than it is in June. People generally are not going to be major consumers of ice cream at the beach when the weather is in the 50s. Other than the that I think the temperatures are relatively similar so business should be consistent enough throughout the year.
